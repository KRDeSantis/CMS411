E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC)
Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) Trainer
Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS)
E4B-PWS-FY19-20
10 January 2020

Scope
Title
E-4B Aircraft Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) Trainer
Background
The E-4B mission suite has been modified to incorporate new LFTS long wire operations.  To capitalize on historical lessons learned and promote future growth, a training system will be provided.  This training system will allow for full operations and maintenance training on the LFTS system with no impact to aircraft availability. 
Task Description
The LFTS Trainer will facilitate training of the LFTS system for mission crew familiarization, operations and procedural scenarios, and maintenance troubleshooting and repairs. The trainer will allow for the development and execution of operational scenarios with the ability to assess individual responses and promote crew interaction through simulated operations. The trainer will provide the ability to demonstrate normal and degraded operations through instructor generated fault insertion and mission events. While the initial delivery encompasses the modification affected by LFTS, as the E-4B mission systems evolve, the trainer will keep pace with all modifications to maintain crew readiness and capability, as well as maximize operational aircraft availability.
Additionally, the goal is to create a virtual trainer that can be quickly reconfigured with software changes vice hardware modifications.  With the elimination of hardware dependencies, system availability is increased, and total life cycle costs are reduced.
Objective
The Contractor shall develop, manufacture/procure, test, document and deliver an E-4B LFTS Trainer that:
•	Shall give Air Force or Contractor instructors an interactive system to train LFTS operators and maintenance personnel.
•	Shall support continuous training through all phases to include annual training certification.
The contractor shall accomplish all tasks in order to provide the Government engineering and technical support to the E-4B program that addresses the requirements throughout this section (1.4) and in Section 3 of this document.
Hardware/Configuration
System
The LFTS Trainer configuration shall support four (4) trainee locations and two (2) instructor positions.  All trainer system hardware:
•	Shall consist of Commercial Off-the-Shelf, non-proprietary items to allow sustainment flexibility. 
•	Shall be of an appropriate size to support physically or through emulation the operations environment (E-4B 7.17 Console Station).
•	Shall support clear visual definition without pixelization or blurring.
•	Shall be a standalone system.
•	Shall support updates to applications, operating systems, and security environment through removable media (optical discs or console port).
•	Shall be compatible with aircrew personal headset interconnections.
The trainee consoles:
•	Shall emulate the E-4B 7.17 console station 
•	Shall place the trainee in the same approximate physical position and posture as in the aircraft.
•	Shall include all indicators, switches, and panels in aircraft representative locations.
•	Shall include virtual operator interfaces for all subsystems to include power control (circuit breakers). 
•	Shall support exporting of the emulated environment in a standalone format to enable students to gain familiarity in other computing environments such as a Computer Based Training Lab.
Facility
The LFTS Trainer should not require extensive facility modifications or its own dedicated facility for operation or storage.  This trainer will be employed in an office environment with standard ceilings, doors and floors. The LFTS Trainer:
•	Shall be capable of being housed inside a typical office space.
•	Shall consist of components capable of being moved through a standard 80” tall by 36” wide door. 
•	Shall operate on standard 110/220V 60Hz power. 
•	Shall not exceed a room footprint of 500 sq ft.
•	Shall include an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) to enable graceful shutdown of the system server/s.
Training 
Training shall emulate the controls, switches, instrumentation, displays, and mission systems, along with their correct functionality and performance characteristics and be representative to the aircraft in location, function, and representation in order to train all tasks based on actual procedures as documented in the published E-4B technical data.
LFTS training sessions:
•	Shall replicate operation of the aircraft in normal, degraded, and emergency modes.
•	Shall include simulation modes for preflight, airborne mission, and post flight states.
•	Shall be capable of running a time-based scenario where discrete actions and inputs are injected based on a predetermined scenario or ad hoc by the instructor.
•	Shall be capable of injecting different faults, failures, and indications.
•	Shall be capable of capturing the configuration and settings of the Trainer in a “Snapshot” and utilize the Snapshot settings as an initial condition set for loading the Trainer.
•	Shall send and receive data between all trainee and instructor positions as well as other simulated crew positions and simulated ground observer.
•	Shall provide graphical displays to the instructor with situational awareness of the scenario as well as repeaters of the trainee panels/displays.
•	Shall be fully monitored and controlled by the instructor.
•	Shall support two simultaneous training sessions.
•	Shall permit review and replay of the training scenario, including audio communications to enable reconstruction for instructional purposes.
LFTS Training:
•	Shall include all operations functions for the LFTS wire operations based upon actual procedures as documented in the published E-4B technical data (operations and maintenance manuals).
•	Shall correlate the applicable visual and audio simulation scene during wire movement.
•	Shall display virtualized or previously recorded operation of reel and drogue that will react to and mirror the input of operator actions in real time.
•	Shall emulate LFTS connectivity and transmission of Emergency Action Messages (EAM) based upon the E-4B Message Processing System (MPS) Software.
The contract shall provide a priced option to run the MPS application as whole.
